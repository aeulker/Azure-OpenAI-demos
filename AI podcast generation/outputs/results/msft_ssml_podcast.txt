Do you think they\u2019ll beat expectations this time?</voice><voice name='en-US-Jenny:DragonHDLatestNeural'>Mmm, I mean, looking at their past performance, they usually do pretty well, right? Their PE ratio is sitting at 35.20.</voice><voice name='en-US-Brian:DragonHDLatestNeural'>True, but a high PE ratio can be a bit risky too, right? It\u2019s like, do investors expect too much?</voice><voice name='en-US-Jenny:DragonHDLatestNeural'>Yeah, it\u2019s a double-edged sword! But hey, with all their products like Office 365 and Teams, they\u2019ve got a strong foothold in the market.</voice><voice name='en-US-Brian:DragonHDLatestNeural'>And don\u2019t forget about Microsoft 365 Copilot!

You gotta be quick, haha!</voice><voice name='en-US-Jenny:DragonHDLatestNeural'>Haha, right? So, what do you think?
