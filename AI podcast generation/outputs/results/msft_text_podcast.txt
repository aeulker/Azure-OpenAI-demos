[Jenny] Hey everyone! Welcome back to another episode of 'Market Buzz!' I'm Jenny.

[Brian] And I’m Brian! Uhm, today we’ve got some exciting stuff to chat about—Microsoft Corporation, or MSFT as the cool kids say.

[Jenny] Haha, right?! So, Brian, did you catch the latest stock price? It’s sitting at 426.31 right now!

[Brian] Wow, that’s a nice jump of over two and a half percent! I mean, what’s going on there? Is it time to buy?

[Jenny] Yeah, totally! It’s like everyone’s been buzzing about it. Like, their market cap is over 3 trillion—no big deal.

[Brian] Right? And did you see the earnings date coming up? January 29, 2025? That’s gonna be a big one.

[Jenny] Oh for sure! And you know how it is with earnings reports. Everyone’s either holding their breath or biting their nails.

[Brian] Haha, exactly! I mean, what do you think? Do you think they’ll beat expectations this time?

[Jenny] Mmm, I mean, looking at their past performance, they usually do pretty well, right? Their PE ratio is sitting at 35.20.

[Brian] True, but a high PE ratio can be a bit risky too, right? It’s like, do investors expect too much?

[Jenny] Yeah, it’s a double-edged sword! But hey, with all their products like Office 365 and Teams, they’ve got a strong foothold in the market.

[Brian] And don’t forget about Microsoft 365 Copilot! That thing is a game-changer. It’s all about AI now!

[Jenny] Ugh, I love it! It’s like they’re making everything smarter and easier to use. Who wouldn’t want that?

[Brian] Right? And I read somewhere that they’ve got about 228,000 full-time employees. That’s a small city!

[Jenny] Haha, yeah! So, uh, let’s talk dividends too. They’ve got a forward dividend yield of 0.78%. That’s not too shabby!

[Brian] Exactly! It’s like, if you’re investing, you’re not just hoping for stock price increases, but also for some cash flow!

[Jenny] Totally! And the ex-dividend date is coming up on February 20, 2025. So, if people want that dividend, they better pay attention!

[Brian] Wow, it’s like a game of musical chairs! You gotta be quick, haha!

[Jenny] Haha, right? So, what do you think? Should folks be looking at MSFT as a solid investment?

[Brian] I mean, I think it’s definitely worth considering, especially with all the innovation happening there.

[Jenny] For sure! But, as always, do your research, folks! Don’t just take our word for it.

[Brian] Exactly! And hey, if you’re interested in this topic, we’d love to dive deeper into tech stocks in future episodes.

[Jenny] Yes! And maybe even explore how AI is shaping the industry. That would be super fun!

[Brian] Oh, I’d love that! Alright, folks, that’s a wrap for today’s episode. Thanks for tuning in to 'Market Buzz!'

[Jenny] Yeah! Stay informed, and happy investing! See you next time!
