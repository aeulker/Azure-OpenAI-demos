    "\n",
    "+ Creating a search index.\n",

    "## Architecture overview\n",
    "Agentic retrieval builds on top of three core components of Azure AI Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Index: Your search index holds both plain text and vectorized content, organized under a semantic configuration. Text fields marked as searchable and retrievable feed the LLM for query planning and grounding, while vector fields support similarity search when you enable a vectorizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent: A new top-level resource that links your Azure AI Search service to an Azure OpenAI model. It encapsulates the modelâ€™s endpoint, authentication, and default parameters for reranking thresholds, reference inclusion, and runtime limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieval engine: Orchestrates the end-to-end flow: invoking the LLM for query planning, dispatching subqueries to the index in parallel, collecting results, reranking, and packaging the final grounding data along with metadata arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic retrieval marks a departure from traditional search features, and a shift to knowledge retrieval capabilities intentionally designed to ground agents."

      "\n",
