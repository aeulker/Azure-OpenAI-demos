    "# 5 AutoGen - Enabling LLM-powered agents to cooperate\n",
    "\n",
    "The AutoGen ecosystem provides everything you need to create AI agents, especially multi-agent workflows -- framework, developer tools, and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework uses a layered and extensible design. Layers have clearly divided responsibilities and build on top of layers below. This design enables you to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core API implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power. It also support cross-language support for .NET and Python.\n",
    "AgentChat API implements a simpler but opinionated API for rapid prototyping. This API is built on top of the Core API and is closest to what users of v0.2 are familiar with and supports common multi-agent patterns such as two-agent chat or group chats.\n",
    "Extensions API enables first- and third-party extensions continuously expanding framework capabilities. It support specific implementation of LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, AzureOpenAI), and capabilities such as code execution.\n",

      "In the ever-evolving landscape of the stock market, few stories capture the imagination quite like the meteoric rise of certain tech giants. Over the past month, Salesforce (CRM) and Google (GOOGL) have emerged as standout performers, with Salesforce boasting an astonishing 1688.74% increase in stock price, while Google has also made waves with a commendable 62.16% rise. What’s behind these remarkable figures? Let’s dive into the data and explore the potential catalysts driving this surge.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Numbers Speak\n",
      "\n",
      "To put these impressive gains into perspective, let’s take a closer look at the current stock prices and percentage changes for both companies:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Company   | Current Price | Percentage Change (1 Month) |\n",
      "|-----------|---------------|------------------------------|\n",

      "\n",
      "These numbers are not just statistics; they represent a significant shift in investor sentiment and market dynamics. But what could be fueling such dramatic increases?\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Salesforce Surge\n",
      "\n",
      "Salesforce’s staggering rise can be attributed to several factors. The company has been at the forefront of cloud computing and customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, which have become increasingly vital for businesses navigating the digital landscape. Recent innovations, strategic acquisitions, and a robust earnings report may have contributed to heightened investor confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Salesforce has been actively expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities, making it an attractive option for businesses looking to streamline operations and improve customer engagement. This growth trajectory, coupled with positive market sentiment, has undoubtedly played a role in the stock’s explosive performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Google’s Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Google’s 62.16% increase is no small feat either. As a leader in digital advertising and cloud services, Google has consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a competitive market. Recent developments, such as advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, have positioned Google as a key player in the tech industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Google’s ongoing efforts to diversify its revenue streams, particularly through its cloud computing services, have garnered attention from investors. The company’s ability to innovate and stay ahead of market trends has solidified its reputation as a reliable investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Investigating the News\n",
      "\n",
      "To further understand the factors influencing these stock movements, it’s essential to look at recent news articles related to both companies. A Python script can be employed to fetch the latest headlines and insights, providing a clearer picture of the narratives shaping investor perceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By analyzing news sentiment and key themes, we can identify whether product launches, partnerships, or market trends have played a role in the stock price increases. This deeper dive into the news landscape will help us connect the dots between market performance and external influences.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market is a complex ecosystem, and the recent performance of Salesforce and Google serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of this environment. With Salesforce’s astronomical rise and Google’s solid growth, investors are keenly watching these tech titans. As we continue to monitor their progress, it’s crucial to stay informed about the factors driving these changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the world of investing, knowledge is power. By leveraging data and insights, we can make more informed decisions and better understand the forces at play in the market. \n",

      "\n",
      "In the ever-evolving landscape of the stock market, few stories capture the imagination quite like the meteoric rise of certain tech giants. Over the past month, Salesforce (CRM) and Google (GOOGL) have emerged as standout performers, with Salesforce boasting an astonishing 1688.74% increase in stock price, while Google has also made waves with a commendable 62.16% rise. What’s behind these remarkable figures? Let’s dive into the data and explore the potential catalysts driving this surge.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Numbers Speak\n",
      "\n",
      "To put these impressive gains into perspective, let’s take a closer look at the current stock prices and percentage changes for both companies:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Company   | Current Price | Percentage Change (1 Month) |\n",
      "|-----------|---------------|------------------------------|\n",
      "| Salesforce (CRM) | $287.63       | 1688.74%                     |\n",
      "| Google (GOOGL)   | $166.54       | 62.16%                       |\n",
      "\n",
      "These numbers are not just statistics; they represent a significant shift in investor sentiment and market dynamics. But what could be fueling such dramatic increases?\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Salesforce Surge\n",
      "\n",
      "Salesforce’s staggering rise can be attributed to several factors. The company has been at the forefront of cloud computing and customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, which have become increasingly vital for businesses navigating the digital landscape. Recent innovations, strategic acquisitions, and a robust earnings report may have contributed to heightened investor confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Salesforce has been actively expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities, making it an attractive option for businesses looking to streamline operations and improve customer engagement. This growth trajectory, coupled with positive market sentiment, has undoubtedly played a role in the stock’s explosive performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Google’s Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Google’s 62.16% increase is no small feat either. As a leader in digital advertising and cloud services, Google has consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a competitive market. Recent developments, such as advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, have positioned Google as a key player in the tech industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Google’s ongoing efforts to diversify its revenue streams, particularly through its cloud computing services, have garnered attention from investors. The company’s ability to innovate and stay ahead of market trends has solidified its reputation as a reliable investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Investigating the News\n",
      "\n",
      "To further understand the factors influencing these stock movements, it’s essential to look at recent news articles related to both companies. A Python script can be employed to fetch the latest headlines and insights, providing a clearer picture of the narratives shaping investor perceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By analyzing news sentiment and key themes, we can identify whether product launches, partnerships, or market trends have played a role in the stock price increases. This deeper dive into the news landscape will help us connect the dots between market performance and external influences.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market is a complex ecosystem, and the recent performance of Salesforce and Google serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of this environment. With Salesforce’s astronomical rise and Google’s solid growth, investors are keenly watching these tech titans. As we continue to monitor their progress, it’s crucial to stay informed about the factors driving these changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the world of investing, knowledge is power. By leveraging data and insights, we can make more informed decisions and better understand the forces at play in the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Stay tuned for more updates as we explore the latest developments in the tech sector and beyond!\n",

      "# The Rollercoaster Ride of NVDA and TSLA: A Month in Review\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fast-paced world of stock trading, few companies capture the imagination of investors quite like NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). Both titans of technology, they not only lead their respective industries but also serve as barometers for market sentiment. Over the past month, their stock prices have experienced significant fluctuations, reflecting broader trends in technology and automotive sectors. Let’s dive into the numbers and explore what they reveal about these two powerhouse companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## NVIDIA: A Steady Ascent\n",
      "\n",
      "NVIDIA has been on a remarkable upward trajectory, showcasing a blend of resilience and growth. Starting the month at a closing price of **$96.91** on April 21, NVDA saw a steady climb, reaching **$135.57** by May 19. This represents an impressive increase of approximately **40%** in just under a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Highlights:\n",
      "- **April 21 - April 30**: The stock began to gain momentum, closing at **$106.43** on April 24, and peaking at **$111.61** on May 1.\n",
      "- **May 1 - May 20**: The most significant surge occurred in the second half of the month, with NVDA closing at **$135.34** on May 14, before slightly retracting to **$135.57** by May 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "This upward trend can be attributed to NVIDIA's strong performance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, particularly in sectors like gaming and artificial intelligence, which continue to drive demand for their products.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tesla: A Wild Ride\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla, on the other hand, has had a more volatile month. Starting at **$227.50** on April 21, TSLA experienced a rollercoaster of highs and lows, ultimately closing at **$344.71** on May 20. This represents a staggering increase of about **51%** over the same period, but not without its share of bumps along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Highlights:\n",
      "- **April 21 - April 30**: Tesla's stock surged from **$227.50** to **$292.03** by April 29, showcasing a robust demand for electric vehicles and positive market sentiment.\n",
      "- **May 1 - May 20**: After a slight dip to **$275.35** on May 6, TSLA rebounded dramatically, closing at **$347.68** on May 14, before settling at **$344.71** by May 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla's fluctuations can be attributed to various factors, including production updates, market competition, and broader economic indicators affecting consumer spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Comparative Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "When we juxtapose the two stocks, it’s clear that both companies are thriving, albeit in different ways. NVIDIA's growth has been more consistent, while Tesla's journey has been characterized by sharp spikes and dips. This divergence highlights the unique challenges and opportunities each company faces in their respective markets.\n",
