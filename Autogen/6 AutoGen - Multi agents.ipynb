    "# 6 AutoGen - Multi agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The AutoGen ecosystem provides everything you need to create AI agents, especially multi-agent workflows -- framework, developer tools, and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework uses a layered and extensible design. Layers have clearly divided responsibilities and build on top of layers below. This design enables you to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core API implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power. It also support cross-language support for .NET and Python.\n",
    "AgentChat API implements a simpler but opinionated API for rapid prototyping. This API is built on top of the Core API and is closest to what users of v0.2 are familiar with and supports common multi-agent patterns such as two-agent chat or group chats.\n",
    "Extensions API enables first- and third-party extensions continuously expanding framework capabilities. It support specific implementation of LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, AzureOpenAI), and capabilities such as code execution.\n",

Additionally, you’ve included a useful tip about learning basic French phrases, which is very important when traveling in France, as it can significantly enhance communication, show respect for the local culture, and often lead to a warmer reception from local residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Language and Communication Tips:\n",
      "1. **Basic Phrases**: It's advisable to learn useful phrases such as:\n",
      "   - \"Bonjour\" (Hello)\n",
      "   - \"Merci\" (Thank you)\n",
      "   - \"S'il vous plaît\" (Please)\n",
      "   - \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" (Do you speak English?)\n",
      "   - \"Je ne parle pas bien français.\" (I do not speak French well.)\n",
      "   \n",
      "   These can help in daily interactions and will be appreciated by locals.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Apps and Tools**: Download a translation app on your smartphone, such as Google Translate or Duolingo, which can assist with translations and pronunciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Signage and Menus**: Be prepared for menus and signs to primarily be in French, especially in less touristy areas. You might consider carrying a small phrasebook or using a translation app for unfamiliar terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Dining Etiquette**: When dining, remember that it's polite to greet the staff with a \"Bonjour\" when entering a restaurant or shop and to say \"Au revoir\" when leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cultural Nuances**: Understanding and respecting local customs, like dining times and greetings, can greatly enhance your experience. For example, lunch typically runs from 12 PM to 2 PM, and dining is often a leisurely affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the integration of language tips into your travel plan is satisfactory, as these strategies will empower you to engage more comfortably and meaningfully with your surroundings. Enjoy your trip to France!\n",
