      "### Practical Tips\n",
      "- **Timing**: Spring (March-May) and Fall (September-November) are ideal for pleasant weather and fewer crowds. Summer is busy, and winter can be chilly but magical with holiday decorations.\n",
      "- **Transport**: Use the Paris Métro—it’s efficient and covers most attractions. Get a Paris Visite pass or Navigo card for unlimited rides.\n",
      "- **Language**: Learn basic French phrases like “Bonjour” (hello), “Merci” (thank you), and “Parlez-vous anglais?” (Do you speak English?). Locals appreciate the effort.\n",
      "- **Safety**: Watch for pickpockets in crowded areas like the Métro or near landmarks. Keep valuables secure.\n",
      "- **Duration**: If you have 3-5 days, focus on the top landmarks and a couple of neighborhoods. With more time, add day trips like Versailles or Disneyland Paris.\n",
